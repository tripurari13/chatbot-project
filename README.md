## 🚀 **Features**
- Handles customer queries with pre-defined responses.
- REST API for interaction with the chatbot.
- Stores chat history in an online database.
- Easily testable via browser or API tools.
- Runs fully online with GitHub Codespaces.

---

## 🛠️ **Setup and Deployment**

1. **Create a GitHub Repository** and launch **GitHub Codespaces**.
2. **Generate a Spring Boot project** via [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io).
3. **Upload the project to Codespaces**.
4. **Set up the database connection** in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://your-host:3306/your-db
   spring.datasource.username=your-username
   spring.datasource.password=your-password
   ```
5. **Build and run the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
6. **Access your app** via the forwarded port in Codespaces.

## 🔧 **API Endpoints**
- `GET /api/chat` → Get a welcome message.
- `POST /api/chat` → Send a customer query and get a response.

Example POST request:
```json
{
    "message": "What are your business hours?"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "response": "Our business hours are 9 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Friday."
}
```

---

## 🧠 **Next Steps**
- Add more dynamic responses using machine learning or rule-based logic.
- Integrate external APIs for live data.
- Deploy the chatbot to a public server.
